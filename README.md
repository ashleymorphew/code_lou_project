Resume

This is a one-page resume website that includes my summary, job experience, education, skills, and a contact form. 

Selected features:

A navigation menu that expands across the page for large screens, and can be opened and closed using the hamburger icon with smaller screens.

CSS grid is used to structure the layout of the page, with four columns on desktop, two columns for tablets, and one column for mobile. 

Both of the name and email fields within the contact form are validated; if nothing is entered the page will alert "form must be filled out!". If name is not entered the page will alert "name must be filled out!", and if email is left empty it will alert "email must be filled out!".
